TCWG images
-----------

Docker images used by the TCWG team are generated slightly differently
from the other ones. The source files describing the images contents
are stored under tcwg-base, in nested directories where nesting shows
images dependencies. For instance, tcwg-build type of images depend on
tcwg-base.

If you want to (re)build locally a TCWG image after updating its
Dockerfile.in or its build.sh, go to the directory whose name fully
describes the image. For instance
xenial-arm64-tcwg-base/xenial-arm64-tcwg-build, and run ./build.sh
from there to rebuild the xenial-arm64-tcwg-build image.

TCWG's Dockerfiles in DISTRO-ARCH-tcwg-base/* directories are generated
from Dockerfile.in templates in respective tcwg-base/* directories.  Run
tcwg-base/generate-dockerfiles.sh (without parameters) whenever you
change any of Dockerfile.in templates -- this will update all affected
Dockerfiles.

Once Dockerfiles are regenerated, you should test your change locally
by building the image.  For this go to image's directory and run
"./build.sh".  "./build.sh" script uses name of current directory to
determine distro version and other parameters, so it's important
to run "./build.sh" from its own directory.

Note that "./build.sh" will first re-build all images that current image
is derived from.  E.g., *-tcwg-dev image will first re-build respective
*-tcwg-base image -- this can take a lot of time for the first run,
but, once cache is populated, re-builds are very quick.
