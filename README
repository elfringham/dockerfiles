TCWG images
-----------

Docker images used by the TCWG team are generated slightly differently
from the other ones. The source files describing the images contents
are stored under tcwg-base, in nested directories where nesting shows
images dependencies. For instance, tcwg-build type of images depend on
tcwg-base.

If you want to (re)build locally a TCWG image after updating its
Dockerfile.in or its build.sh, go to the directory whose name fully
describes the image. For instance
xenial-arm64-tcwg-base/xenial-arm64-tcwg-build, and run ./build.sh
from there to rebuild the xenial-arm64-tcwg-build image.
